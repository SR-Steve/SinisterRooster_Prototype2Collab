// Frantz Felix  10/21/15 
/*
Description: This script if for climbing boxs. In a nutshell, I use a  verticle ray cast by expanding the bounds of the torso collider and making the ray's origin at the top-right-most
position, to check if a box infront of the player is the correct size to climb,then I check if she is close enough to climb, If both of these are true then I have a bool thats 
named "canClimb" equal true.  Once this is true and the players position is equal or greater then the postion of the box plus one, It makes the player kinematic, moves their
positon up and over, to the top of the box. 
*******************************************
Some changes I need to make in the future are : Fix this to work with boxes of all sizes, so I can get rid if checking against the box position *plus one*. For this I will probably just 
add half of the boxes size  to the boxs position. I need to flip the ray cast with the player. I need to find a better way to get her to "climb" the box because 
right now the player is basically teleporting on top of the box. This also needs to work for boxs of different sizes. I need to put in certain places where the art team 
can animate her climb. I need to play around with the ray distance(s) and not make them infinate. Lastly I need to make the code a little bit more readable I will probly put somethings in functions of their own.

Update: 11/19/15(baby castle)
Need to press E to climb to stop the "climbing while touching box bug" also implimented the climbing with forces,
but the force in the x direction is still teleporting player over.
